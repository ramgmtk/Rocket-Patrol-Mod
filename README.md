# Rocket-Patrol-Mod
Mod Point Breakdown

S-Rank Tier:
Simultaneous two-player mode (50)
    1p controls: arrow keys and enter
    2p controls: a, d keys and f
    Added scoring native to each player. Game determines winner based of who has the highest score.
    There is collision between players, and deducts points from both sides.

Intermediate Tier:
Create a new spaceship type...etc. (25)
    Smaller spaceship added that moves much faster and is worth more points.
    Spaceship has its own sprite and is a different color to help identity it.

Novice Tier:
Implement parallax scrolling (15)
    Additional tilesprite added that visualises a poorly drawn asteroid field.
    The new background appears over the existing starfield, however it moves slower relative to the starfield. Because asteroids move and are not still relative to the spaceships like stars, I tried to make it appear as though there is some movement through scrolling.

Starting Tier:
Allow player to control the Rocket after it's fired (10)
    Removed the condition that stopped player from moving while the rocket is in a firing state. I adjusted the Rockets distance travelled to compensate for the easier controls.

Total points earned should tiers be satisfied: (100)
